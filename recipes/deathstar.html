    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bend your sheet metal into the preferred shape for your Death Star, usually a sphere will do
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the metal ball by bringing your Death Star to the nearest White Dwarf and holding it there for at least 5 hours
        </li>
        <li>
            After the metal hardens, let it cool down then fill it with storm troopers
